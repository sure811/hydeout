### Question Definition
All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

For example,
```
Given s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT",

Return:
["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"].
```
### Java Solution
```java
public List<String> findRepeatedDnaSequences(String s) {
    Set seen = new HashSet(), repeated = new HashSet();
    for (int i = 0; i + 9 < s.length(); i++) {
        String ten = s.substring(i, i + 10);
        if (!seen.add(ten))
            repeated.add(ten);
    }
    return new ArrayList(repeated);
}
```
