### Question Definition
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.

However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.

Example:
```
n = 10, I pick 8.

First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.

Game over. 8 is the number I picked.

You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
Given a particular n â‰¥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.
```
### Java Solution
```java
public int getMoneyAmount(int n) {
    int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][n + 1];
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = i - 1; j > 0; --j) {
            int global_min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            for (int k = j + 1; k < i; ++k) {
                int local_max = k + Math.max(dp[j][k - 1], dp[k + 1][i]);
                global_min = Math.min(global_min, local_max);
            }
            dp[j][i] = j + 1 == i ? j : global_min;
        }
    }
    return dp[1][n];
}
```
